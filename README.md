# AgroMart Admin Dashboard Protection

This implementation protects the admin dashboard from unauthorized access and allows for admin user management without registration.

## Implementation Details

1. **User Model Update**
   - Added 'admin' to the enum of valid user types in the User model

2. **Admin User Creation**
   - Created a script `create-admin.js` to add an admin user directly to the database
   - Admin credentials: admin@agromart.com / agromart123

3. **Dashboard Protection**
   - Updated the route in App.jsx to use ProtectedRoute with admin role requirement
   - Added authentication checks in the AdminDashboard component
   - Admin-specific logout functionality

## How to Set Up the Admin User

1. Run the `create-admin.bat` file included in the project root
   - This will add the admin user to your MongoDB database
   - You should see a success message if the operation completes

2. Alternative: Navigate to the backend directory and run the script directly

## How to Access the Admin Dashboard

1. Log in with the admin credentials:
- Email: admin@agromart.com
- Password: agromart123

2. After successful login, navigate to /admin-dashboard or click on the admin dashboard link if available

## Security Features

- Direct URL access is prevented - users must log in first
- Authentication is verified when the dashboard loads
- User role is checked to ensure only admin users can access the dashboard
- Proper logout handling

## Next Steps

For enhanced security, consider:
1. Implementing 2FA for admin accounts
2. Creating an admin user management interface
3. Setting up audit logging for admin actions
4. Enforcing password rotation and complexity requirements
